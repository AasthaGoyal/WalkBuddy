# WalkBuddy

WalkBuddy is an application designed to help female students from AUT and the University of Auckland to feel safe while walking to from one place to another. 

The application will match you with a buddy that has the app, that is near your location, that similar characteristics to you, i.e. female university student, and has the same destination as you. The application will then arrange a meet up point. These meet up points are public transport stops in Auckland, taken from the Auckland Transport API. After meeting up with your buddy, you will both tap "I've met my buddy" and the application will start your walk. After you have both arrived at your destination, you can tap the "I've arrived safely" button and the application will end your walk.

This application was designed and implemented (an MVP) by a team of 5 students (called the Muffin Girls) participating in the Create Camp 2020, a special event (semi-hackathon) hosted by Summer of Tech and ANZ. 

This application was presented to a panel of judges from the industry and was awarded Best in Overall Impact.
